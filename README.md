# Task Tracker

I made a simple tracker app with FlutterðŸ’™  where you can track your tasks or habits
For database operations, I used the Hive package.

Note: [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) is a NoSQL database. It is a dart package used in Flutter applications to store and manipulate data locally.
